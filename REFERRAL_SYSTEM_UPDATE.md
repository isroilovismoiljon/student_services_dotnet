# Referral System Implementation

## Changes Made

### Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: When registering with a `referralId`, the value was not being saved and remained `null`
- **Cause**: No validation logic was in place to check if the referral user exists

### Solution Implemented

Updated `AuthService.RegisterAsync()` method in `StudentServicesWebApi.Infrastructure/Services/AuthService.cs`:

1. **Referral Validation** (Lines 41-54)
   - Check if `ReferralId` is provided
   - Validate that the referral user exists in the database
   - Return error if referral ID is invalid

2. **Referral Bonus** (Lines 71-77)
   - After successful user creation
   - Add 1000 to the referral user's balance
   - Update the referral user's `UpdatedAt` timestamp
   - Save changes to the database

### How It Works

```csharp
// When registering with a referral ID
POST /api/Auth/register
{
    "username": "newuser",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "password": "Password123",
    "referralId": 5  // ID of the user who referred
}
```

**Process:**
1. System validates that user with ID 5 exists
2. If not found: Returns error "Invalid referral ID. The referral user does not exist."
3. If found: Creates new user with `referralId = 5`
4. Adds 1000 to the balance of user ID 5
5. Returns success response

### Benefits
- ✅ Referral ID is now properly saved
- ✅ Invalid referral IDs are rejected immediately
- ✅ Referral user automatically receives 1000 bonus
- ✅ Both users' data is updated correctly

### Testing

To test the referral system:

1. **Get a user ID to use as referral:**
   ```bash
   GET http://147.45.142.61/api/Auth/...
   ```

2. **Register with referral ID:**
   ```bash
   POST http://147.45.142.61/api/Auth/register
   {
       "username": "testuser123",
       "firstName": "Test",
       "lastName": "User",
       "password": "Test123",
       "referralId": 1
   }
   ```

3. **Verify referral user's balance increased by 1000**
